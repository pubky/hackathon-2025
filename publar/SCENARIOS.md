# Publar Scenarios

## What Are Scenarios?

Scenarios are automated test sequences that allow you to programmatically create, configure, and test Pubky networks in Publar. Instead of manually clicking through the UI to add homeservers, create clients, connect them, and write/read data, scenarios define all these operations in a JSON file that can be executed with a single click.

### Why Use Scenarios?

- **Reproducible Testing**: Run the same test sequence consistently across development sessions
- **Regression Testing**: Quickly verify that your changes don't break existing functionality
- **Complex Setups**: Create multi-node networks with precise timing in seconds instead of minutes
- **Documentation**: Scenarios serve as executable documentation of network behavior
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate Pubky network testing in your build pipeline (future feature)

### How They Work

Scenarios define a sequence of time-stamped operations:
1. **Create** homeservers and clients
2. **Wait** for services to become ready
3. **Connect** clients to homeservers
4. **Write** data to homeservers
5. **Read** data back to verify operations

All operations execute automatically at their specified times, with results visible in the event log and network visualization.

## Storage Location

Scenarios are stored in `~/.publar/scenarios/` as JSON files and are automatically loaded when Publar starts.

## JSON Schema

Scenarios are defined in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Scenario Name",
  "description": "What this scenario tests",
  "operations": [
    {
      "at_seconds": 0.0,
      "type": "create_homeserver",
      "id": "homeserver-1"
    },
    {
      "at_seconds": 1.0,
      "type": "wait_for_homeserver",
      "homeserver_id": "homeserver-1",
      "timeout_seconds": 5.0
    },
    {
      "at_seconds": 2.0,
      "type": "create_client",
      "id": "client-1"
    },
    {
      "at_seconds": 3.0,
      "type": "connect_client",
      "client_id": "client-1",
      "homeserver_id": "homeserver-1"
    },
    {
      "at_seconds": 4.0,
      "type": "write_data",
      "client_id": "client-1",
      "path": "/pub/publar/test.txt",
      "content": "Hello from Publar!"
    },
    {
      "at_seconds": 5.0,
      "type": "read_data",
      "client_id": "client-1",
      "path": "/pub/publar/test.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Action Types

### create_homeserver
Creates a new homeserver instance.

```json
{
  "type": "create_homeserver",
  "id": "unique-homeserver-id"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for this homeserver

---

### wait_for_homeserver
Waits for a homeserver to become ready before proceeding.

```json
{
  "type": "wait_for_homeserver",
  "homeserver_id": "homeserver-1",
  "timeout_seconds": 5.0
}
```

**Fields:**
- `homeserver_id` (string): ID of the homeserver to wait for
- `timeout_seconds` (number): Maximum time to wait (default: 5.0)

---

### create_client
Creates a new client with a generated keypair.

```json
{
  "type": "create_client",
  "id": "unique-client-id"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for this client

---

### connect_client
Connects a client to a homeserver (performs signup).

```json
{
  "type": "connect_client",
  "client_id": "client-1",
  "homeserver_id": "homeserver-1"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `client_id` (string): ID of the client to connect
- `homeserver_id` (string): ID of the homeserver to connect to

---

### write_data
Writes data to a homeserver via a connected client.

```json
{
  "type": "write_data",
  "client_id": "client-1",
  "path": "/pub/publar/example.txt",
  "content": "Data to write"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `client_id` (string): ID of the connected client
- `path` (string): Path to write to (e.g., `/pub/publar/file.txt`)
- `content` (string): Content to write

---

### read_data
Reads data from a homeserver via a connected client.

```json
{
  "type": "read_data",
  "client_id": "client-1",
  "path": "/pub/publar/example.txt"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `client_id` (string): ID of the connected client
- `path` (string): Path to read from

---

## Timing

The `at_seconds` field determines when each operation executes relative to the scenario start time.

- Operations execute sequentially in the order they appear
- Use precise timing for realistic network behavior
- Consider homeserver startup time (usually ~1 second)

## Examples

Example scenario files included with Publar (automatically copied to `~/.publar/scenarios/` on first run):
- `simple_connection.json` - Basic homeserver + client + write/read
- `multi_client.json` - One homeserver with multiple clients
- `rate_limiting.json` - Stress test with rapid operations

## Loading Scenarios

### From UI
1. Click "Import" button in the topbar (center section)
2. Select a JSON file from your filesystem
3. The scenario will be copied to `~/.publar/scenarios/`
4. Select the scenario from the dropdown
5. Click "Play" to execute

### From Code
```rust
use std::fs;
let json = fs::read_to_string("/path/to/my_scenario.json")?;
let scenario = Scenario::from_json(&json)?;
```

## Saving Scenarios

### From UI
1. Create your network topology manually (homeservers, clients, connections)
2. Click "Export" button in the topbar (center section)
3. Choose a filename (will be saved to `~/.publar/scenarios/`)
4. The scenario is automatically available in the dropdown

### From Code
```rust
let json = scenario.to_json()?;
fs::write("~/.publar/scenarios/my_scenario.json", json)?;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive IDs**: `homeserver-main` instead of `hs1`
2. **Add wait operations**: Allow time for homeservers to become ready
3. **Stagger connections**: Don't connect all clients at once unless testing load
4. **Comment with description**: Use the description field to explain what's being tested
5. **Start simple**: Test basic operations before complex scenarios

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Scenario fails with "not ready" error
- **Solution**: Increase wait time or add `wait_for_homeserver` operations

**Issue**: Connections fail
- **Solution**: Ensure homeserver is created and ready before connecting clients

**Issue**: Write operations fail
- **Solution**: Ensure client is connected to homeserver first

**Issue**: Invalid JSON error
- **Solution**: Validate JSON syntax, check all required fields are present

## Scenario Storage Location

All scenarios are stored in `~/.publar/scenarios/`. This location:
- Persists across application updates
- Is accessible from any terminal/file manager
- Works correctly when Publar is distributed as a binary
- Is automatically created if it doesn't exist

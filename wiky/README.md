# Pubky Decentralized Wiki

A decentralized wiki application built on the Pubky protocol, enabling users to create, edit, and share wiki pages in a truly decentralized manner.

## Description

Pubky Wiki is a desktop application that leverages the Pubky decentralized protocol to provide a censorship-resistant, user-owned wiki platform. Built with Rust and egui, it offers a native GUI experience for creating and managing wiki content that is stored on your own Pubky homeserver. Users authenticate via QR code scanning with the Pubky Ring app, ensuring secure and decentralized identity management.

Key features:

- **Stop arguing, start forking**: Multiple valid perspectives can coexist and be discoverable
- **Decentralized Storage**: Wiki pages are stored on the page author's homeserver, not on centralized servers
- **User Ownership**: You control your content through your Pubky identity

## Use-Cases

- **Personal Knowledge Gardens** - Create your own wiki pages on any topic, stored on your Pubky Homeserver, building an interconnected web of knowledge you fully control
- **Fork Controversial Topics** - Clone any wiki page to your homeserver and present alternative perspectives on contested subjects (scientific debates, historical events, political issues)
- **Academic Research Collaboration** - Researchers can fork and extend each other's work, creating branching interpretations while maintaining clear provenance and attribution
- **Bias-Aware Journalism** - Report on news events with multiple perspectives visible through your social graph, showing which of your trusted contacts have different versions
- **Community-Curated Documentation** - Technical communities can maintain multiple valid approaches to problems, with users discovering versions through their web of trust rather than central authority
- **Educational Content Evolution** - Students and teachers fork course materials to adapt them for different contexts, creating a living curriculum that improves through iteration
- **Censorship-Resistant Publishing** - Publish sensitive information that survives takedown attempts by existing across multiple homeservers in your network
- **Credible Exit from Platforms** - Take your entire wiki content with you when switching homeservers, maintaining all links and discoverability without platform lock-in
- **Trust-Weighted Discovery** - Browse topics and automatically see which versions your friends, colleagues, or follows have endorsed through their forks
- **Semantic Link Networks** - Build associative trails between related concepts across different authors' wikis, creating emergent knowledge graphs

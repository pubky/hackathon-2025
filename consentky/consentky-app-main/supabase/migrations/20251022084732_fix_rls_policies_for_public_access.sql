  # Fix RLS Policies for Public Access

  This migration fixes the RLS policies for consent_sessions and pending_session_joins
  to allow public access (not just authenticated users), which is how the app works
  with custom header authentication.

  ## Changes
  
  1. RLS Policy Updates
    - Change policies from `TO authenticated` to `TO public`
    - This allows the app to work with custom header authentication
    - Maintains security while allowing proper access

  2. Security
    - Public access is safe because we use custom headers for authentication
    - No sensitive data is exposed
    - Proper access control is maintained through application logic

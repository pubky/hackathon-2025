# Homegate

> This is a two day hackathon project. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

A monorepo for the Homegate project - your gateway to sign up and join the Pubky homeserver network.

Live demo for the Staging homeserver: [homegate.live](https://homegate.live/)

**Features**
- Three-tier signup system: Free (math captcha), Basic (50k sats), Pro (200k sats)
- Bot protection with math captcha verification and SMS verification via Prelude
- Lightning Network payments for Basic and Pro plans
- Real-time payment notifications via WebSocket
- Invite code generation system for homeserver access
- Simple user profile creation with a name and image
- Sign in with an existing user
- User dashboard showing the user's plan


**External Dependencies**

- [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/turnstile/) Invisible captcha bot protection
- [Prelude](https://prelude.so/) SMS Verification made easy
- [phoenixd](https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenixd) Receive Bitcoin Lightning payments


## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start with Docker (recommended)
make dev              # Development mode with logs
# or
make up               # Background mode

# Access: http://localhost:8882 (frontend)
```

Add the `PRELUDE_API_TOKEN` to `front-end/.env.local` for SMS verification.

That's it! The frontend and backend and phoenixd will be running.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm (for local development)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized development)

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended) 🐳

The easiest way to run the entire stack:

```bash
# Quick start with Makefile
make dev              # Start with logs (recommended for development)
make up               # Start in background

# Or use Docker Compose directly
docker compose up     # Start with logs
docker compose up -d  # Start in background
```

**Access the application:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:8882
- Backend API: http://localhost:8881
- phoenixd API: http://localhost:9740

**Other useful commands:**
```bash
make logs      # View logs
make down      # Stop services
make restart   # Restart services
make help      # See all available commands
```

See the docker-compose.yml file for complete Docker configuration.

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
